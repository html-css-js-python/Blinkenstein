# Blinkenstein

Blinkenstein is a simple KiCad PCB design intended as a functional test board.
It is designed to verify PCB manufacturing quality, assembly correctness, and basic
circuit functionality using classic CMOS logic.

## 1. Overview

Blinkenstein is an LED sequencing circuit built primarily from through-hole components,
with one SMD component included to verify mixed-technology assembly.
The design emphasizes simplicity, low power consumption, and ease of visual inspection.

---

## 2. Functional Description

The circuit sequentially activates LED pairs in the following order:

`RED → GREEN → BLUE → YELLOW`

Although eight LEDs are present on the PCB, only two LEDs are active at any given time.
The circuit serves as a functional indicator rather than a lighting device.

The core of the design is a CD4017 decade counter.
Clock pulses are generated by a discrete oscillator based on the tunneling effect.
These pulses are inverted and conditioned by a NOT gate with a Schmitt trigger input,
providing a clean and stable clock signal for the counter.
